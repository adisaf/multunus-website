        <div class="case-study-synopsis">
          <p>bidPress, a product for custom printed t-shirts and other apparel, is gaining significant traction. One of their most recent customers is a programmer at Google, who chose bidPress over CustomInk (de-facto market leader in the US) to print t-shirts for her team’s 5K race.</p>
          <p>We are human because we are not animal, nor machine. But such thinking has been rendered progressively less tenable by the advent of evolutionary and neo-evolutionary theories which postulate a continuum in nature between animals and Man.</p>

            bidPress currently caters to the US market. There’s a bunch of products (CustomInk, Teespring, CafePress, Threadless, etc) out there already in this space. So why one more, you ask?
            The USP for bidPress is that we can print custom t-shirts and other apparel cheaper and faster than the competition.
            While most other products own printing machines and manage the whole production process themselves, bidPress collaborates exclusively with local printers. These printers have customers other than bidPress as well. But they take on bidPress orders when they have excess capacity - that is, when they don’t have enough orders from other customers to keep their presses busy.
            bidPress gets great rates from these printers - in return, printers look for a steady stream of work, especially during their lean times.

          <p class="case-study-text">Once the printer ink runs dry it has to be replaced with another inkjet cartridge. There are many reputed companies like Canon, Epson, Dell, and Lexmark that provide the necessary cartridges to replace the empty cartridges. Replacing inkjet cartridge can add to a very big cost. It could be worse if you have to replace the empty cartridges frequently every month. Nowadays many buyers are making use of compatible Inkjet Cartridges as they are less expensive and are easily available online. These compatible inkjet cartridges are available from the third party at a much lower price. These cartridges can be replaced by the printer ink of similar brand.
