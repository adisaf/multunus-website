As mentioned 
[in this blog post](http://www.multunus.com/2012/10/our-experience-with-jekyll-and-octopress/), we were looking for a simple solution for Live Editing the website created using Octopress and deploy it to Heroku. This post is about how to edit Website using Prose.io and deploy it using Jenkins.

With 
[Prose.io](http://prose.io/about.html), you can edit any Github files, but you need to run 
rake generate command for generating the HTML files before deploying them. So you will need the setup to deploy, even if the editing can be done online.

Follow the following steps to setup 
[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) or any 
[Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) server for deployment:*Add the following in 
_config.yml:


#prose.io settings
prose:
rooturl: "source"
metadata:
    "source/_posts": |
layout: post
title: "Change Title"

*Setup Prose.io - just login with your Github Handle

    
*Create a script with as follows:


bundle install
bundle exec rake generate
git add public/
git commit -m "Deploying Generated files"


*Install the Heroku gem and setup the git remote and keys for deployment as mentioned 
[here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git)

    
*Setup Git Publisher to push the generated files to heroku as shown below.

Thats it. You are done. Just by clicking of a button, the changes gets deployed. With this setup anyone who has access to the Github Repo can make changes and deploy.

This post is written using Prose.io and deployed through Jenkins.

Yes, the setup was not as easy I had written above. I got stuck mainly with the following.


*I got stuck as the command 
rake generate was watching the file changes. It was not getting stopped. The culprit was 
auto: true in _config.yml file.

    
*If the file extension is .html, Prose.io will not show preview or metadata information. The markdown or md extension would work.

    
*Thought of using Travis.io as mentioned 
[here](http://www.harimenon.com/blog/2013/01/27/auto-deploying-to-my-octopress-blog/) for the deployment. But had issues with setting up Heroku setup with the same. Didn’t continue on that as we’ve been using Jenkins as our CI server for long.
