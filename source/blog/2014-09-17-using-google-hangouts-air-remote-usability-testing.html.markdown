Convenience is one of the key advantages of Remote Usability Testing. You don't need to get the participant in-house and it works especially well when your users are spread across different locations.

But that could just turn around if your tools start to give-up on you. With remote testing, you now have 2 points of failure - participant's and your's. There could be restrictions on installing new software on the participants machine and problems with setting up the microphone and internet issues could easily gobble up the allotted time.


##Hangout on Air


For for past couple of tests, we tried 
**Google Hangout on Air**
 and liked it for the following reasons:


*Most participants already have it installed and know how to use Google Hangout.

    
*Screen Sharing is just a click away.

    
*Unlike some screen recording solutions, you don't have to worry about recording both the participant's and your voice.

    
*You can add as many observers as needed.

    
*After you are done, it saves the video on YouTube for you.

    
*Even if you get disconnected, the session continues and you can join where you left.

    
*It's free :) .


##How-to



*Make sure to have your Youtube account connected to your google plus account.

    
*Go to 
[Google+ Hangouts](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/onair) and create a new 
**Hangout on Air**
.

    
*If you don't want the hangout to be publicly available, make sure to remove 'Public' and Add the participant's email.

    
*Though you can schedule start and end times, you will have to manually start the session for it to start recording.

    
*To download the video for offline use, go to 
[your videos on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/my_videos) and you'll find a "Download MP4" in the video drop-down.


##Gotchas



*We found Google Hangout to drain the laptop battery too fast. If you or the participants are on the laptop, being connected to the charger is a must.

    
*Even if you think the test will take only 25 min, keep a buffer of 15-20 minutes to account for Technical Issues and Timezone differences.

    
*While sharing the screen, the webcam of the participant is turned off. So won't be able to see the participant's face.
