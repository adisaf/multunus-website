          <p class="case-study-text"><ul>
              <li>The company's Linux media player platform for the TVs in the clinic waiting rooms was a major success. However, the off-the-counter mobile device management solution from Canonical wasn't meeting the demands of regular updates and good control over the field devices.</li>
              <li>The clinics wanted a personal content device so that doctors in examination rooms could communicate better with patients increasing patient engagement and increasing rates of recovery from medical conditions. The company also wanted a custom mobile device management solution tailored for android tablets in the long term.</li>
              <li>The ad format(Adobe Flash) from the drug manufacturers was hard to reuse as is on the Android tablet platform</li>

                <p class="case-study-text">Once the printer ink runs dry it has to be replaced with another inkjet cartridge. There are many reputed companies like Canon, Epson, Dell, and Lexmark that provide the necessary cartridges to replace the empty cartridges. Replacing inkjet cartridge can add to a very big cost. It could be worse if you have to replace the empty cartridges frequently every month. Nowadays many buyers are making use of compatible Inkjet Cartridges as they are less expensive and are easily available online. These compatible inkjet cartridges are available from the third party at a much lower price. These cartridges can be replaced by the printer ink of similar brand.
