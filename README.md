### Acknowledgements

We got started with Middleman thanks to Chris Toomey of thoughtbot. His [excellent introductory video](https://upcase.com/videos/building-static-sites-with-middleman) on building static sites with Middleman and the accompanying [sample application](https://github.com/thoughtbot/upcase-middleman-sample) provided much of the inspiration for building this site.
