        <div class="case-study-synopsis">
          <p>Are we human because of unique traits and attributes not shared with either animal or machine? The definition of “human” is circular: we are human by virtue of the properties that make us human (i.e., distinct from animal and machine). It is a definition by negation: that which separates us from animal and machine is our “human-ness”.
          </p>
          <p>We are human because we are not animal, nor machine. But such thinking has been rendered progressively less tenable by the advent of evolutionary and neo-evolutionary theories which postulate a continuum in nature between animals and Man.</p>

        <p class="case-study-text">
          Rohan Mathew started The Intersect Fund as a non-profit institution to serve the less privileged and to help make their dreams a reality.
          The Intersect Fund specifically focuses on immigrant workers or long unemployed but skilled people.
          But they need funds to start a small entrepreneurial venture and make a decent living. We are talking about ice-cream cart owners, the local bakers or the falafel vendors of the tri-state area.

          Unfortunately, if you don’t have a good credit rating, access to loans to start even low investment ventures is almost impossible.
          The Intersect Fund solves their problem by giving out microloans - typically in the range of $5,000 to $20,000 at very reasonable interest rates.
          “Do something well or not at all”. Read on to learn on that motto of Rohan is leading the way for us to build a world class solution for Intersect Fund’s less privileged customers.

          <p class="case-study-text">
            Most of the systems till recently were built by Rohan using simple tools like Excel spreadsheets and Zoho workflow creators.
            With the business growing and loan applications pouring in, Rohan needed a platform that could scale for faster loan processing and a nation wide roll out.
            Most CEOs in Rohan’s shoes would have gone for an off-the-shelf solution. But Rohan, an ardent Apple fan boy, could not convince himself to use clunky, expensive and slow enterprise software.
            Instead, he tasked Multunus to build a loan processing system that would be as simple to use as an iPhone and as feature packed as a Mac Pro. The entire platform would take about 3 years to build.
            Here’s a sample of Closer - a critical module of a much larger system.

          <p class="case-study-text">Once the printer ink runs dry it has to be replaced with another inkjet cartridge. There are many reputed companies like Canon, Epson, Dell, and Lexmark that provide the necessary cartridges to replace the empty cartridges. Replacing inkjet cartridge can add to a very big cost. It could be worse if you have to replace the empty cartridges frequently every month. Nowadays many buyers are making use of compatible Inkjet Cartridges as they are less expensive and are easily available online. These compatible inkjet cartridges are available from the third party at a much lower price. These cartridges can be replaced by the printer ink of similar brand.
